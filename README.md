Transcriptional repression and enhancer decommissioning silence cell cycle genes in postmitotic tissues_Bootstrapping Analysis in R

These files contain R scripts used to perform non-parametric bootstrapping statistical analysis on genomic distribution and peak per gene quantifications from ATAC-Seq data. The ATAC-Seq data came from Drosophila (fruit fly) wings, eyes, and brains as well as data from the mouse retina. The data were bootstrapped 1000 times and the resulting datasets were processed to generate 95% confidence intervals.
